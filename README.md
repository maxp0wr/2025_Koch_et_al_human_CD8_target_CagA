Currently under construction in preparation for review

This folder contains the notebook for the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing including CDR3 sequencing data derived from gastric T cells of pediatric and adult patients infected with Helicobacter pylori and uninfected controls (total 12).  This analysis is part of the paper "Human CD8+ T cells target epitopes derived from by Helicobacter pylori translocated CagA" by M.R.A. Koch et al., 2025.
